## Methods

### Freeze Trial (Recommended)
IDM provides a 30-day trial period. This option locks the trial period for lifetime so you won't have to reset the trial again and your trial won't expire.
IDM updates can be installed directly without having to freeze it again.

### Activation
Registers IDM with full functionality. Your activation remains permanent and undetected.

### Reset IDM Activation / Trial
Resets the IDM activation or trial period. Use this if you encounter any issues or want to start fresh.

### Check IDM Status
Checks the current status of your IDM installation (activated, in trial, or expired).

### Backup/Restore IDM Settings
Allows you to backup your current IDM settings and restore them later if needed.

2. Then run **Option 1 (Freeze Trial)** again

### IDM Not Detected

### If Detection Occurs
1. Run **Option 3 (Reset)** to clear everything
2. Then run **Option 1 (Freeze Trial)** to reapply
